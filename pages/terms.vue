              We have implemented technical measures designed to secure your personal information from
              unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure and accidental loss. However, we cannot guarantee
              that unauthorized third parties will not use your personal information for improper purposes or be

              No registration is required to use the Service. However, in order to access certain features of the

              should there be any unauthorized use or breach of security of your profile or account. The Service
              will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your profile or account.
              However, you shall be liable for any losses incurred by the Company or others due to such
              unauthorized use. You may never use another Member's profile or account without permission. When you
              provide the Service your email address, you consent to our using the email address in accordance
              with our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>
              In the sole discretion, the Service may temporarily or permanently suspend, terminate, or otherwise
              refuse to permit your access to the Service without notice and liability, if, in Service's sole
